      CTO building scalable, secure data-intensive SaaS systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m a technology leader with over three decades of experience building, modernizing,
      and operating data-intensive SaaS systems. My work spans hands-on architecture,
      data engineering, and executive decision support, with a consistent focus on building
      systems that are understandable, resilient, and useful over long periods of time.
    </p>

    <p>
      I focus on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designing and evolving data-intensive SaaS platforms that support real operational and financial decisions</li>
      <li>Owning architecture, reliability, security, and cost in systems that need to scale without unnecessary complexity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I’ve spent much of my career working in production systems where longevity matters.
      That experience has shaped how I approach architecture today: prioritizing clarity over
      cleverness, minimizing operational burden, and making deliberate tradeoffs so systems can
      be sustained and evolved long after they’re built.
    </p>

    <p>
      I currently serve as CTO at a data-driven SaaS company, where I focus on platform evolution,
      analytics, and decision support for operators and investors.
    </p>
