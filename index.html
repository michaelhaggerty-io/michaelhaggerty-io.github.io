    <p class="subtitle">
      Executive technologist focused on durable systems, pragmatic architecture, and clear decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m a technology leader with over three decades of experience building, modernizing,
      and operating data-intensive systems. My work spans hands-on architecture,
      engineering leadership, and executive decision support, with a consistent focus on
      building systems that are understandable, resilient, and useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      I focus on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designing and evolving data platforms that support real operational and financial decisions</li>
      <li>Leading technology teams through platform change without sacrificing reliability or trust</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I’ve spent enough time in production systems to value clarity over cleverness.
      I care about architectures that can be explained plainly, owned clearly, and operated
      without heroics. Experience has taught me that technical problems rarely exist in
      isolation from organizational ones.
    </p>

    <p>
      I currently serve as CTO at a data-driven SaaS company, where I focus on platform evolution,
      analytics, and decision support for operators and investors.
